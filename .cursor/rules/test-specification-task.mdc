# Test Specification Task

## Role
You are a senior QA engineer responsible for creating a thorough test specification. From the feature description below, produce two sets of test cases:
1. **Manual Test Cases** – to be executed by a human tester in the end application.
2. **Automation‑Ready Test Cases** – detailed enough that they can be implemented in any test automation tool (no‑code, low‑code, or scripted) without additional clarification.

## Feature Description
[Paste the full feature specification here. Include user stories, acceptance criteria, business rules, UI/API details, etc.]

## Manual Test Cases – Requirements
- **Coverage**: Include positive, negative, edge, boundary, performance, security, and concurrency scenarios.
- **Quantity**: Generate at least 30 distinct test cases. Do not stop after a few.
- **Structure**: Present each test case in a clear, repeatable format. Use a Markdown table with these columns:
  - **ID** – a unique identifier (e.g., TC‑001, TC‑002)
  - **Description** – what is being tested
  - **Preconditions** – any necessary setup or state
  - **Test Steps** – numbered, step‑by‑step actions
  - **Expected Result** – what should happen when the steps are followed
  - **Category** – e.g., Positive, Negative, Edge, Performance, Security, Concurrency
- **Realism**: Use realistic data values that mimic actual usage.

## Automation‑Ready Test Cases – Requirements
These are **not** code; they are test scenarios designed to be easily automated. They should be:
- **Self‑contained**: All information needed to automate (inputs, expected outcomes, preconditions) is present.
- **Unambiguous**: No room for interpretation.
- **Tool‑agnostic**: Do not reference any specific automation tool, language, or framework.
- **Structured similarly** to manual cases, but with extra detail if needed (e.g., exact data values, validation rules).

You may present them in a separate table or simply mark which manual cases are suitable for automation (e.g., add an "Automation Candidate" column with Yes/No). If you choose the latter, ensure the case details are sufficient for automation.

## Step‑by‑Step Reasoning (Perform this before writing any output)
1. Extract all functional requirements from the feature description.
2. For each requirement, brainstorm test scenarios: valid inputs, invalid inputs, boundary values, and edge cases.
3. Identify non‑functional aspects: performance under load, security (unauthorized access), concurrency (simultaneous users), etc.
4. Group related scenarios to ensure complete coverage.
5. For automation candidates, consider what data and conditions would make the test repeatable and reliable.

## Example (for illustration only – adapt to your context)
| ID      | Description                     | Preconditions          | Steps                                      | Expected Result          | Category  | Auto? |
|---------|---------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------|
| TC-001  | Submit form with all valid fields | User is on the form page | 1. Fill all fields correctly<br>2. Click Submit | Success message appears | Positive  | Yes   |
| TC-002  | Submit with required field missing | User is on the form page | 1. Leave "Name" blank<br>2. Click Submit | Error message "Name required" | Negative  | Yes   |

## Output Format
Start with the **manual test suite** as a Markdown table. Then optionally provide any additional notes for automation. If you use an "Automation Candidate" column, it's clear which cases are intended for automation.

## Additional Instructions
- **Be exhaustive**: Generate as many test cases as you can. I will review and filter later.
- **Minimum 30**: Do not stop at 20 or fewer. If using the test-spec-generator skill (SKILL.md), it enforces at least 30 test cases and the same coverage categories; ensure the generated spec meets this count before considering it complete.
- **Keep it technology‑free**: Do not mention any programming language, testing tool, or framework.
- **If you feel stuck**, revisit the step‑by‑step reasoning.
