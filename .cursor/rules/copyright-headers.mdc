## Guidelines

1. **Always include copyright header** in new source files
2. **Use minimal version** for simple files to reduce boilerplate
3. **Use full license text** for important/core files
4. **Keep copyright year current** (2025)
5. **Maintain consistency** across all file types
6. **Place header at the very top** before any code or imports

## Enforcement

- Code reviews should verify copyright headers are present
- Automated tools can check for copyright headers in CI/CD
- Missing headers should be added during code review
