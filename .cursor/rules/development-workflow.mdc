# Development Workflow

## Task Breakdown

### Task Structure
Break down user stories into specific, actionable tasks:
- Each task should be completable in 2-8 hours
- Tasks should have clear acceptance criteria
- Document dependencies between tasks
- Include technical notes for implementation guidance

### Task Template
```markdown
### T1: Task Name
- **Description:** Clear description of what needs to be done
- **Estimated Hours:** N hours
- **Assignee:** TBD
- **Status:** Not Started
- **Dependencies:** List of dependencies (other tasks or user stories)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Specific, testable criterion
  - [ ] Another criterion
- **Technical Notes:** Implementation details, technical decisions, patterns to follow
```

## Dependencies

### Identifying Dependencies
- **Always identify dependencies:**
  - List prerequisite user stories (e.g., "US-08-01 (needs MCP server)")
  - List prerequisite tasks within the same story (e.g., "T1 (needs MCPServer)")
  - Ensure dependencies are unblocked before starting
  - Example: "US-08-01 (needs MCP server), US-04-02 (needs search API)"

### Dependency Types
- **Story Dependencies:** Other user stories that must be completed first
- **Task Dependencies:** Other tasks in the same or different stories
- **External Dependencies:** External services, libraries, or infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

### Guidelines
- Make criteria specific and testable
- Use checkboxes for clarity
- Include performance requirements (e.g., "Tool latency <1s")
- Include functional requirements
- Include non-functional requirements (error handling, logging)

### Example Acceptance Criteria
```markdown
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] search_code tool handler implemented
  - [ ] Accepts query and filters
  - [ ] Returns search results
  - [ ] Tool latency <1s
  - [ ] Error handling for invalid queries
  - [ ] Unit tests with >80% coverage
```

## Status Tracking

### Task Status Values
- **Not Started:** Task not yet begun
- **In Progress:** Task actively being worked on
- **In Review:** Code review or QA in progress
- **Done:** Task completed and accepted

### Status Updates
- Update status as work progresses
- Mark dependencies clearly
- Update status when blocking dependencies are resolved

## Story Points Estimation

### Estimation Guidelines
- 1 Story Point ≈ 4-6 hours of work (varies by team)
- Consider complexity, not just time
- Account for testing, documentation, and review time
- Re-estimate if scope changes significantly

## Sprint Planning

### Story Selection
- Select stories based on sprint capacity
- Consider dependencies between stories
- Prioritize based on business value
- Ensure stories are "ready" (Definition of Ready met)

### Definition of Ready
A story is ready for sprint when:
- [ ] User story clearly written (As a... I want... So that...)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined and testable
- [ ] Story points estimated by team
- [ ] Dependencies identified and unblocked
- [ ] Technical tasks broken down
- [ ] Test scenarios documented
- [ ] Demo script approved by PO
- [ ] No blocking questions

## Definition of Done

A task is considered done when:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Unit tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Performance requirements met (if specified)
- [ ] Demo successfully presented (for user stories)

## Technical Notes

### Always Include Technical Notes
- Document how to implement the task
- Reference specific libraries or frameworks to use
- Include code patterns or examples
- Explain integration with other components
- Document configuration requirements

### Technical Notes Template
```
**Technical Notes:** 
- Use [library/framework] for [purpose]
- Follow [pattern/architecture]
- Integrate with [component/service]
- Configuration: [property]=[value]
- Example: [code snippet or reference]
```

## Code Review

### Review Checklist
- Code follows project standards and patterns
- Tests are comprehensive (>80% coverage)
- Documentation is updated
- Security guidelines are followed
- Performance requirements are met
- Error handling is appropriate

## Demo Preparation

### Demo Requirements
- Story is demonstrable at end of sprint
- Demo script is prepared
- Acceptance criteria are verified
- No critical bugs
- Documentation is complete
