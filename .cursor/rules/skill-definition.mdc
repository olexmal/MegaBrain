# Cursor Agent Skills – Definition

## What a Skill Is

An **Agent Skill** is a portable, version-controlled package that teaches the Cursor agent how to perform a specific task or workflow. Skills extend the agent with domain-specific instructions, templates, and (optionally) scripts.

**Characteristics:**
- **Portable** – Work across projects; can be personal or shared via repo
- **Version-controlled** – Stored as files (e.g. in `.cursor/skills/` or `~/.cursor/skills/`)
- **Actionable** – Can include scripts, templates, and reference docs the agent uses when needed
- **Progressive** – Supporting files (e.g. `template.md`, `reference.md`) are loaded on demand to keep context efficient

## Where Skills Live

| Scope        | Path                 | Use case                          |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Project** | `.cursor/skills/<skill-name>/` | Team-shared, committed to repo     |
| **Personal**| `~/.cursor/skills/<skill-name>/` | Available in all your projects     |

**Important:** Do not create or edit skills in `~/.cursor/skills-cursor/`; that directory is reserved for Cursor’s built-in skills.

## Required Structure

Each skill is a **directory** whose entry point is **SKILL.md**:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required – main instructions and metadata
├── template.md           # Optional – templates, examples
├── reference.md          # Optional – detailed reference
└── scripts/              # Optional – helper scripts
```

### SKILL.md Requirements

1. **YAML frontmatter** with:
   - **name** – Skill identifier: lowercase, letters/numbers/hyphens only, max 64 chars
   - **description** – What the skill does and **when** to use it (used for discovery; write in third person, include trigger terms)

2. **Markdown body** – When to apply the skill, step-by-step instructions, output format or template, and links to optional supporting files (e.g. `template.md`, `reference.md`).

## How Skills Are Used

- **Discovery** – Cursor discovers skills at startup from the paths above.
- **Automatic use** – The agent applies a skill when the user’s request matches the skill’s description and instructions.
- **Manual invocation** – User can type `/` in the agent chat to search and select a skill, then provide input (e.g. paste a feature description).

## Creating or Editing Skills

- Keep **SKILL.md** under ~500 lines; put long examples or reference material in separate files.
- **Description** must be specific and include both what the skill does and when to use it.
- Use consistent terminology and one-level-deep links to supporting files (e.g. `[template.md](template.md)`).
