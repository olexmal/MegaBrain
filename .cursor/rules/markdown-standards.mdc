# Markdown Standards

Follow CommonMark / GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). One space after `#`; no skipped heading levels. Prefer asterisks for emphasis (better compatibility than underscores in mid-word).

## Headings

- Use ATX style only: `#` through `######`. One space after the hashes.
- One H1 per file. Increase level by one (no jumps like `##` to `####`).
- Put a blank line before and after headings.

```markdown
# Document Title

## Section

### Subsection
```

## Paragraphs and line breaks

- Separate paragraphs with a single blank line. Do not indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.
- For a line break within a paragraph: end the line with two spaces, or use `<br>`.

```markdown
First paragraph.

Second paragraph.  
Same paragraph, new line.
```

## Emphasis

- **Bold:** `**text**` or `__text__`. Prefer `**` for consistency.
- **Italic:** `*text*` or `_text_`. Prefer `*` for mid-word emphasis (e.g. `un*fix*able`).
- **Bold and italic:** `***text***`.
- **Strikethrough (GFM):** `~~text~~`.

```markdown
**Bold**, *italic*, ***both***, ~~strikethrough~~
```

## Lists

- **Unordered:** Use `-` (preferred), or `*` or `+`. Indent nested items with 2 spaces.
- **Ordered:** Use `1.` for all items (auto-numbering). Indent nested with 2 spaces.
- **Task lists (GFM):** `- [ ]` unchecked, `- [x]` checked. Use in acceptance criteria and checklists.

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item

1. First step
2. Second step

- [ ] Todo
- [x] Done
```

## Links

- **Inline:** `[link text](url)`. Use relative paths for in-repo links.
- **Reference-style (optional):** `[text][ref]` with `[ref]: url "optional title"` elsewhere. Useful when the same URL is reused.
- **Auto-links:** Raw URLs may be linked automatically; for clarity prefer `[descriptive text](url)`.

```markdown
[README](../README.md)
[API docs](https://example.com/api)
[ref link][api]
[api]: https://example.com "API Documentation"
```

## Images

- Syntax: `![alt text](url)` or `![alt][ref]`. Always provide meaningful `alt` for accessibility.
- Prefer relative paths for images in the repo.

```markdown
![Diagram of architecture](docs/images/arch.png)
```

## Code

- **Inline:** Single backticks: `` `variable` ``. Escape backticks inside with `` \` ``.
- **Fenced blocks:** Triple backticks, optional language tag for syntax highlighting. Use a tag when possible (e.g. `java`, `typescript`, `bash`, `json`).

```markdown
Use the `searchService.search()` method.
```

Fenced block: start a line with three backticks and optional language (e.g. `java`, `typescript`), add the code, then a line with three backticks only.

## Blockquotes

- Start a line with `>`. Use `>>` for nested quotes. Blockquotes can contain other block elements.

```markdown
> Main quote.
> Same paragraph.

>> Nested quote.
```

## Horizontal rules

- Use `---` or `***` or `___` on a line by itself (min 3 characters). Blank line before and after.

```markdown
Section one.

---

Section two.
```

## Tables (GFM)

- Pipes `|` for column boundaries. Header row, then separator row with at least three `-` per column.
- Alignment: `:---` left, `:---:` center, `---:` right. Keep columns aligned for readability.
- Use `<br>` for line breaks inside cells if needed.

```markdown
| Left    | Center  | Right   |
| :------ | :-----: | ------: |
| col1    | col2    | col3    |
| **ID**  | **Desc**| **Val** |
```

## Escaping

- Backslash escapes: `\*` `\_` `\#` `\[` `\]` `\(` `\)` `\` `\<` `\>` etc. Use when you need literal punctuation that would otherwise be interpreted as Markdown.

```markdown
Literal \*asterisks\* and \#hashes.
```

## Structure (project-specific)

- **New docs:** Add project copyright at the top (see `copyright-headers.mdc`).
- **User stories / tasks:** Follow structure and required fields in `documentation-standards.mdc`.
- **Test specs:** Use the test-spec template: Reviewers, Introduction, References, Test Cases (ID, Description, Preconditions, Test Data, Steps, Expected Results, Category).

## Conventions

- End sentences with one period. No trailing spaces (except when intentionally creating a line break with two spaces).
- Prefer short paragraphs and bullet lists for scannability.
- In tables, use **Bold** for column headers or key labels (e.g. **ID**, **Steps**, **Expected Results**).
- Avoid emoji in technical docs unless the project style allows; do not rely on `:shortcodes` (support varies).
