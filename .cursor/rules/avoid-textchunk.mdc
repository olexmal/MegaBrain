# TextChunk Usage Rule

- Do not reference or use `io.megabrain.ingestion.parser.TextChunk` directly.
- Prefer working with abstractions or downstream data structures that do not expose `TextChunk`.
- If chunk-like data is needed, introduce or use interfaces/value objects that do not depend on `TextChunk`.
